# SET
A JavaScript implementation of the popular [SET card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)).  SET is both a fun solitaire and multiplayer game since it doesn't rely on players taking turns, only pattern recognition speed.

The game consists of 81 cards containing symbols with 3 unique variants of 4 properties: 
* Number of symbols (1, 2, 3)
* Color (red, green, purple)
* Shape (oval, diamond, squiggle)
* Shading (open, striped, solid)

The goal of the game is to identify sets of 3 cards where, for each propertiy, all 3 cards have the same varient or all three cards have a different varient.

To identify a set, simply click 3 cards.  The script checks for the validity of the set before replacing the cards with 3 more from the deck.
